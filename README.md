# newsletter-signup

Deployed **Heroku** link: https://young-coast-65893.herokuapp.com/

_**Note:**_ The Heroku link will not work for signing up, and it would only show a Failure page whenever such a request has been sent, as the _**API key**_ and the _**List ID**_ have been taken out due to _**security concerns**_. If you would like to see the newsletter signup page in action, please don't hesitate to let me know, and I will send over a video tutorial!
